# Script_Generate_Project

Developed a Python script to concatenate multiple Python files into a consolidated 'full_file.py', implemented text preprocessing for machine learning input, 
and created an LSTM neural network model for character prediction, achieving a model that generates coherent code snippets. Trained the model on a diverse 
dataset and implemented model checkpointing for optimization. The project showcases skills in file manipulation, text processing, and deep learning model development.

# Mask_Or_No_mask_image_Recognition

Implemented a mask detection system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces. Preprocessed images, split the dataset 
into training, validation, and testing sets, and constructed a CNN model with two convolutional layers. Utilized ModelCheckpoint to save the best model based on 
validation accuracy during training. Achieved a final accuracy of 95.02% on the test set after 5 epochs, and visualized sample predictions with corresponding 
ground truth labels in a 4x4 grid. The project demonstrates proficiency in computer vision, deep learning, and model evaluation techniques.
